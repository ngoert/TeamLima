App Idea

An app that allows users to donate items to people in their local community. It is similar to Facebook Marketplace in that users can interact with other users and arrange to trade or pick up other usersâ€™ items. There will be no way to exchange money for items in the app as all items will be given away for free. 


Main Features

User Accounts: Upon opening the app for the first time the user will be prompted to create an account. This account will be used to relate listings back to the person who posted them. If the user closes out of the app and comes back they will be asked to login.

Listings Page: The listings page is the home page of our app. On this page users will be able to scroll through items posted by other users in their local area in a manner similar to most social media apps (vertical scrolling). 

Chatting: If a user is interested in another user's items they have the option to open up a chat with them. This change will only exist for as long as the listing is open. When a listing goes down the two users will be unable to chat with each other

Rating: Users can rate other users if they have interacted with them on the app. They are able to rate their experience out of 5 stars. A user's final rating will be the average of all ratings they have received.

Searching: When listings are posted they will be assigned a category. This category can be used to filter all listings on the users listing page.
